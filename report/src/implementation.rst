Tracker
-------

What enables the device to be tracked is a frame from ZaagTechnology that sends through a TUIO protocol the information of all the points tracked inside the frame.

Although this system is currently only working with the ZaagTechnology frame, the TUIO protocol makes it completely independent of the tracker used. For instance, before receiving the frame I was able to simulate the same behavior with my phone and the

Software
--------

git (stats?), python, POO, testing, refactoring, rst for docs, PEP & Python, how  the tracker works, usage of the feedback windows because of the dual here/there, 

Hardward
--------

Arduino, connecting wires, 3D printing, bluetooth vs Wifi, possible enhancement with buzzer / piezo, device component sends a lot of infos but we only deal if it's a change,
